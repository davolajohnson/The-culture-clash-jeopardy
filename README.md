# The-culture-clash-jeopardy
What is Jeopardy? Jeopardy is a quiz show that has a unique answer-and-question format in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers and must phrase their responses in the form of a question. My game focuses on African American culture.
I choose to create Culture Clash Jeopardy because I watched Jeopardy a lot as a child with my grandmother and it was our favrite thing to do.
