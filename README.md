## Description

**What is Jeopardy?**  
Jeopardy is a quiz show that has a unique answer-and-question format in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers and must phrase their responses in the form of a question.

**Culture Clash Jeopardy** focuses on African American culture.

> I chose to create Culture Clash Jeopardy because I watched Jeopardy a lot as a child with my grandmother â€” it was our favorite thing to do.
