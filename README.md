## 📖 Description

**What is Jeopardy?**  
Jeopardy is a quiz show that features a unique answer-and-question format where contestants are given clues in the form of answers and must respond in the form of a question. Examples include:

- Who is...
- Who was...
- What is...

❗ **Do not use punctuation at the end of your answer**

**Culture Clash Jeopardy** centers around African American culture and historical facts.

> I created Culture Clash Jeopardy because I watched Jeopardy a lot with my grandmother — it was one of our favorite things to do.
